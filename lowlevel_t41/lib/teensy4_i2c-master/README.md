# teensy4_i2c
An I2C library for the [Teensy 4](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html)
microcontroller.

The Teensy 4.0 uses the [NXP i.MXRT 1062](https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-microcontrollers/i.mx-rt-series/i.mx-rt1060-crossover-processor-with-arm-cortex-m7-core:i.MX-RT1060)
microcontroller with an ARM Corex-M7 core.

This library can be used as a drop in replacement for the Wire library
in [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html). It has
native APIs that are more flexible than Wire and simpler to use in
some cases.

The driver implementations, IMX_RT1060_I2CMaster and IMX_RT1060_I2CSlave, have
relatively few dependencies on Arduino or the main Teensy libraries. This means
that it should be possible to port them to other devices based on the NXP i.MXRT 1060
series of MPUs.

## Features
* Supports all features that are required by the I2C Specification
for master, multi-master and slave devices.
* Optional drop in replacement for the Wire library in i2c_driver_wire.h
* Master Mode
* Slave Mode
* Standard Mode (100 kbps)
* Fast Mode (400 kbps)
* Fast Mode Plus (1 Mbps)
* Multi-master support
* Clock stretching in Slave Mode
* Non-blocking API for Master Mode and Slave Mode
* Comprehensive error handling
* Can tune the Teensy's electrical configuration for your application
* A single slave can handle multiple I2C addresses
* Glitch filters and line hysteresis in all modes

## Version 2
Version 2 is currently a work in progress. It's available on the `dev` branch.
You're welcome to use it but expect it to change without notice.

The goal of version 2 is to make the driver more reliable and to support
a few more features. See below for a full list of v2 changes.

Please let me know ASAP if your project works Ok with v1 but breaks if you
update to v2. This definitely shouldn't happen!

## Installation
* [Arduino Instructions](documentation/installation/arduino_installation.md)
* [PlatformIO Instructions](documentation/installation/platformio_installation.md)

### GitHub Help
If you're wondering how to get code out of GitHub then you're not alone!
Here are some [instructions for downloading or cloning](documentation/installation/github_help.md)
this library. The page also explains how to download a different branch.

## Usage

### Use I2C Register Wrappers
I2CDevice and I2CRegisterSlave classes make it very simple to follow
the standard I2C pattern of reading or writing to "registers".
I recommend that you use this interface if it's suitable.

1. Download the code and put it in your include path.
2. &#35;include "i2c_device.h" if you have a master and wish
to read from a slave device.
3. &#35;include "i2c_register_slave.h" if you want to implement
a slave device to be read by a master.
4. See the examples in the examples/simple directory

### Use the Driver Directly
The driver interfaces are defined in i2c_driver.h. These provide
everything you need to use I2C without the limitations of the Wire
library. The key classes are I2CMaster and I2CSlave.

1. Download the code and put it in your include path.
2. &#35;include "imx_rt1060_i2c_driver.h"
3. See the examples in the examples/raw directory

### Replacing Wire.h
Follow these instructions if you have already written code to
use Wire.h and don't want to change it. I don't recommend using
the Wire API unless you have to.

1. Download the code and put it in your include path.
2. Change all #includes from Wire.h to i2c_driver_wire.h.
3. If any of your dependencies use Wire.h you'll have to
modify them to use i2c_driver_wire.h instead.
4. If you depend on any libraries that use Wire.h then you'll
have to replace _all_ references to Wire.h to i2c_driver_wire.h
in that library. This is because Arduino compiles all .cpp files
in a library whether you reference them or not.
5. See the examples in the examples/wire directory

If you miss a reference to Wire.h then you'll see compilation errors
like this:-

`... Wire/WireIMXRT.cpp:10: multiple definition of 'Wire'`

You may also see linker errors like this:-

`... bin/ld.exe: Warning: size of symbol 'Wire' changed from 116 in ... teensy4_i2c\i2c_driver_wire.cpp.o to 112 in ... libraries\Wire\WireIMXRT.cpp.o`

## Ports and Pins
This table lists the objects that you should use to handle each I2C port.

| Port | Pins               | imx_rt1060_i2c_driver.h | i2c_driver_wire.h |
|------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| 0    | SCL0(19), SDA0(18) | Master or Slave         | Wire              |
| 1    | SCL1(16), SDA1(17) | Master1 or Slave1       | Wire1             |
| 2    | SCL2(24), SDA2(25) | Master2 or Slave2       | Wire2             |

## Pull Up Resistors
The I2C protocol uses open drain pins. The pins can pull signal voltages low,
but they cannot pull them high. The system relies on pull up resistors to
do this.

This library enables the Teensy's 22 kΩ internal pull up resistor by default.
Many breakout boards with I2C have internal pullups as well.

These internal pullups may or may not be sufficient for your application. It
depends entirely on the bus capacitance. The more devices you connect to the bus
and the longer the wires, the higher the bus capacitance. The only way to be
sure is to measure the rise times for your circuit.

See this [I2C Underneath article](https://github.com/Richard-Gemmell/i2c-underneath/blob/main/documentation/i2c_setup/pull_up_resistors.md)
for information about measuring and tuning rise times.

## Common Problems
Here are some of the common problems that will can break the I2C
connection or just make it very unreliable.
* make sure your wiring has good connections at all times
* you may need external pullup resistors (see above)
* the slave and the master must share a common ground
* if you're upgrading your project from a Teensy 3 with 5V IO to a Teensy 4,
and you already have 4.7 kΩ pullup resistors then you may need to swap them
to 2.2 kΩ. This is because the Teensy 4 IO pins run at 3.3V.
* make sure the master and the slave agree on how many bytes to
send and what order they're in. Data alignment, padding and endianness
may cause issues.
* the Teensy's I2C implementation is inherently asynchronous. Watch out
for bugs where your application code is reading (or writing) to the buffer
that holds your I2C data while the driver is busy transmitting or receiving
the data. This causes a device to see part of one message and part of a later
message. (A partial read bug).

## Version 2
### Breaking Changes
* `set_pad_control_configuration()` and `setPadControlConfiguration()` no
  longer control the internal pullup resistors. Use `set_internal_pullups()`
  and `setInternalPullups()` instead.

### Changes
* glitch filters are now enabled in Slave mode making slave devices more
  resistant to electrical noise
* significantly adjusted signal timings so driver is compliant with
  I2C Specification over the full range of allowed rise times
* fixed bug which caused I2CMaster::finished() to return true before STOP
  was sent to slave.
* you can now enable or disable the internal pullup resistors with
  `set_internal_pullups()` or `setInternalPullups()`
* reduced pin drive strength which significantly reduced voltage
  undershoot spikes on falling clock edges
* tested port 2 (pins 24 & 25) on both Teensy 4.1 and Teensy 4.0
* [analysed and documented](documentation/i2c_design/i2c_timing_analysis.md) I2C timing
  registers to find out what they _really_ do (as opposed to what the datasheet claims!)
* created a [simulator](tools/i2c_timing_calculator/i2c_timing_calculator.py)
  to predict the effect of changing I2C configuration registers
* created dedicated circuit board to provide tunable pullups and a reliable setup
* created automated tests to check I2C signal timings
* created automated tests of I2CSlave behaviour

### Remaining Work (not likely before 2024)
* add more automated tests for I2CMaster behaviour
