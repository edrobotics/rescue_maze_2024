Need to make it clear how it is done whether both edges are counted or just one, with CPR.

Need to check all types, especially float/double with the PID Library

Left to do:
Migrate to teensy?
Tune constants
Handle integral windup
Incorporate PWM "bump"?
Finish calibration routine:
    Make linear regression on the Arduino
    Store the regression function in EEPROM(or other)
