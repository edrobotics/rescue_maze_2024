To test:
Remove current limiting
Lower PWM duty cycle
Higher PWM frequency
Supply voltage 5V
Change IMODE from chopping cycle by cycle to fixed off-time
Acceleration limiting


Tested:
Lower PWM duty cycle - helps
Make PWM frequency higher - helps
Removed current limiting - helps, but not as much as expected?
5V supply did not help. Higher supply voltage does seem to help though
Setting IMODE does not seem to change anything



Other problems:
When running multiple motors, it does not work. Probably due to current drop.


SOLUTION:
When connecting four wires to the benchtop voltge supply, you can drive even one motor on full PWM duty cycle.
One weird thing though: Current limiting does not kick in when completely stopping the motor. Why? The fault pin does not go low
