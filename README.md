# Rescue Maze 2024

Repository for ED Robotics' participation in the Robocup Junior Rescue Maze 2024 competition.

The contents of this repository were used in RoboCup Junior SM (Swedish Championships) 2024.

The code and CAD models are provided as-is, without any additional work done after the competition. The code (and hardware) did not work as expected, so keep that in mind.

## Performance

- RoboCupJunior Sweden 2024: Last place, 5 points :(

## Conclusions

Minimum Viable Product is a good idea that probably should have been prioritised more.

## Note:

This was our second year doing robotics. The code may contain trace amounts of spaghetti.
